## Thumb Contracts
This is a small project I worked on to learn more about smart contract development on Ethereum. It is based on [this course from Buildspace.](https://buildspace.so/p/build-solidity-web3-app)

In the original project, [Hardhat](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat) was used for smart contract development. I opted to use a Rust-based smart contract development suite called [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)


The contract in this repositary is deployed at address [0x1de56614b09671e86bf472d10a9b0ac2c7705a91](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x1de56614b09671e86bf472d10a9b0ac2c7705a91) on the Rinkeby testnet.
